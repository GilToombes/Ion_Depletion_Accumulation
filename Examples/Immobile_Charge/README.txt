Immobile Charge

	Illustrate effects of immobile charges on ion concentrations and currents.

Main Functions
 
	Plot_Whole_Cell_Donnan_Breakin_v4.m
		Plots ion concentrations a voltage during transition from cell-attached to whole-cell configuraiton.

	Plot_Whole_Cell_Donnan_Anion_vs_Cation_v1.m
		Plots ion current and concentration for anion and cation permeable membranes in presence/absence of immobile anions.

Auxillary Functions
 
      	Constraint_J.m
		Describes molar flow between compartments
		Includes treatment of a patch membrane.

	patch_current_GHK
